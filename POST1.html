      <h3>THE Valentine’s CHARITY </h3>
      <p>The Valentine’s Charity event was organized jointly by the African Child Comforters Organization (ACCO) and Elite Trial on 16th February
         2025 at Christ Hope Bugando (City Center), Mwanza, Tanzania. The purpose of the event was to celebrate Valentine’s Day through charitable
         giving by providing school and hygiene supplies to 50 children under the care of the center, which supports orphans and children living 
         with HIV/AIDS. <br><br> Participating organizations included ACCO, Elite Trial, Charity Youth Foundation, the management of Christ Hope
         Center, students from St. Augustine University of Tanzania (SAUT), and local community members. The total funds raised amounted to TSh
         372,400, which were used for donations and event logistics. Donations worth TSh 272,700 included items such as pens, notebooks, soap, pads,
         socks, counters, and snacks for the children. Additional TSh 158,200 covered food and transport expenses, bringing total expenditures to TSh
         430,900. <br> <br>   The day’s activities began with participants departing SAUT at 3:00 a.m. and arriving at the center by 4:30 a.m. The
         program opened with introductions from leaders of each organization, including Madam Agnes Swai (Executive Director of ACCO), Mr. Isack
         Robert (Chairperson), and representatives from Elite Trial and SAUT’s student government. A total of 86 participants attended, including 60
          students, 22 children, 2 caregivers, and 2 lecturers. <br> <br> The event featured teamwork activities such as cleaning, cooking, playing,
        and sharing gifts with the children.  Participants also prepared and shared lunch, engaged in games and dancing, and concluded the day with 
        expressions of gratitude from organizers, caregivers, and the children.<br> <br>  Overall, the Valentine’s Charity was a successful community
       outreach initiative that strengthened collaboration between youth, NGOs, and educational institutions while spreading love and support
        to vulnerable children in Mwanza.

          <h4>About Us</h4>
          <p>
            The African Child Comforters Organisation (ACCO) originated in 2021 as a student support group,
             primarily focused on giving back to vulnerable communities in Mtwara Tanzania. <br> <br>
             A group of dedicated students pooled their pocket money to assist local initiatives, 
             which included providing sanitary pads to secondary school pupils, furnishing primary 
             schools with desks, and promoting environmental protection programs in educational institutions.
