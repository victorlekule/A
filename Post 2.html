      <h3>Damu Salama Bugando</h3>
      <p>On January 11, 2025, the African Child Comforters Organisation (ACCO) in collaboration with Damu Salama Bugando conducted a blood 
        donation exercise at the St. Augustine University of Tanzania (SAUT). The main purpose of this event was to increase the supply of 
        safe blood for patients in need—especially children, pregnant women, and emergency patients—in Bugando Hospital and other health 
        centers in the Lake Zone. <br> <br>The specific objectives of the activity were to educate the community on the importance of blood
         donation, collect sufficient safe blood for patients, encourage youth and students to participate, and strengthen collaboration with 
         health institutions to improve healthcare services. <br> <br>The event was conducted from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. in the open grounds
          of SAUT, where medical officers and health workers from Damu Salama Bugando set up donation stations. Participants, including students,
           university staff, and nearby community members, underwent preliminary health screening before donating blood. Eligible donors received
           cards and education on the personal and social benefits of blood donation. The turnout was encouraging, with many people expressing their 
           willingness to participate in future drives. <br> <br> The results showed a high level of community participation, with a commendable number
            of successful blood donors. The activity demonstrated strong cooperation between the youth and the health sector, highlighting the 
            importance of community involvement in saving lives. <br> <br> However, some challenges were encountered, including ineligible donors 
            due to health conditions, the need for more community education on blood donation, and shortages of medical supplies at certain times.
            <br><br>In conclusion, the event was highly successful and emphasized the value of partnership between social organizations and health
             institutions in saving lives. ACCO recommends conducting regular awareness campaigns, increasing resources and equipment, and 
             providing motivation to donors to enhance participation in future blood donation activities. <br> <br> Overall, the blood donation
             drive at SAUT served as a powerful example of love, unity, and volunteerism in promoting public health and 
             supporting life-saving efforts. br

          <h4>About Us</h4>
          <p>
            The African Child Comforters Organisation (ACCO) originated in 2021 as a student support group,
             primarily focused on giving back to vulnerable communities in Mtwara Tanzania. <br> <br>
             A group of dedicated students pooled their pocket money to assist local initiatives, 
             which included providing sanitary pads to secondary school pupils, furnishing primary 
             schools with desks, and promoting environmental protection programs in educational institutions.
