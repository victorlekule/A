      <h3>The Nuru ya Binti</h3>
      <p>The Nuru ya Binti project, organized by the African Child Comforters Organization (ACCO), is a one-day empowerment
         program scheduled for 28th May 2025 at Nyasubi Primary School (Mwanza) and Gongo la Mboto JICA Primary School (Dar es Salaam). 
         The initiative aims to support  schoolgirls aged 10–18 by addressing menstrual health and gender-based violence (GBV) challenges 
         that hinder their education and wellbeing. <br> <br>ACCO, a youth-led non-profit registered under the NGO Act No. 24 of 2002,
          focuses on improving children’s lives through education, health, and advocacy. The Nuru ya Binti project—meaning “Light of 
          the Girl in School”—seeks to empower girls through menstrual education, pad distribution, and GBV awareness. <br> <br>Key activities
           include distributing sanitary pads, teaching menstrual hygiene and reproductive health, and conducting sessions on GBV 
           awareness and self-protection. These sessions will be delivered through interactive methods such as group discussions, 
           storytelling, and role plays, guided by trained facilitators from the Gender Desk. <br> <br> Expected outcomes include
           improved menstrual hygiene, reduced school absenteeism, greater awareness of GBV, and stronger community support systems. <br><br>In 
           conclusion, Nuru ya Binti is a vital intervention that promotes dignity, confidence, and equal educational opportunities for
            girls, reinforcing ACCO’s mission to create a caring and inclusive environment for all children.

          <h4>About Us</h4>
          <p>
            The African Child Comforters Organisation (ACCO) originated in 2021 as a student support group,
             primarily focused on giving back to vulnerable communities in Mtwara Tanzania. <br> <br>
             A group of dedicated students pooled their pocket money to assist local initiatives, 
             which included providing sanitary pads to secondary school pupils, furnishing primary 
             schools with desks, and promoting environmental protection programs in educational institutions.
