          <h3>SAUTI YA AUTISM PROJECT</h3>
          <p>The "Comfort for Child Life" was the first major project  under the project of SAUTI YA AUTISM undertaken by our founders,
             and it served as the catalyst for the formation and registration  of the African Child Comforters Organization (ACCO) 
             in 2024. <BR> </BR> What began as a youth-led fundraising campaign in November 2021 by students at Ndwika Girls Secondary
              School , rapidly grew into a mission to support the most vulnerable: children with autism. <BR></BR></p>

          <h4>About Us</h4>
          <p>
            The African Child Comforters Organisation (ACCO) originated in 2021 as a student support group,
             primarily focused on giving back to vulnerable communities in Mtwara Tanzania. <br> <br>
             A group of dedicated students pooled their pocket money to assist local initiatives, 
             which included providing sanitary pads to secondary school pupils, furnishing primary 
             schools with desks, and promoting environmental protection programs in educational institutions.
