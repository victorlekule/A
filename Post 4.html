      <h3>SAUTI YA AUTISM PROJECT</h3>
      <p>The "Comfort for Child Life" was the first major project  under the project of SAUTI YA AUTISM undertaken by our 
        founders, and it served as the catalyst for the formation and registration of the African Child Comforters 
        Organization (ACCO) in 2024. <BR></BR>What began as a youth-led fundraising campaign in November 2021 by students
         at Ndwika Girls Secondary School , rapidly grew into a mission to support the most vulnerable: children 
         with autism. <BR></BR>The goal was to address the critical lack of proper sleeping facilities at Lulindi Maalumu 
         School(special school) in Masasi District, Mtwara Region, Tanzania, where students often faced inadequate 
         resources and heightened vulnerability <BR> </BR> 
        <B> Lives Transformed</B> Over 400 people participated in this foundational initiative, driving a powerful 
        social and physical transformation. This massive gathering successfully united a diverse group of key stakeholders
         from parents and teachers to government leaders, religious figures, and dispensary nurses for a vital, hot 
         discussion on autism awareness and solutions to combat stigma. This successful dialogue initiated a major 
         cultural shift toward community inclusion and support. <BR></BR> Simultaneously, the effort secured and delivered 10 
         new beds to the students  at Lulindi Maalumu School(Special school), matching the new social hope with immediate
         physical dignity and  <BR></BR>
         <B>The community speak/Testimonial:</B> "The beds provided by this dedicated group have significantly improved our
         students’ well-being and restored dignity. But it is the courageous awareness dialogue which brought together parents,
         leaders, and teachers that has truly given us hope for an inclusive future for our children."  <BR></BR>

          <h4>About Us</h4>
          <p>
            The African Child Comforters Organisation (ACCO) originated in 2021 as a student support group,
             primarily focused on giving back to vulnerable communities in Mtwara Tanzania. <br> <br>
             A group of dedicated students pooled their pocket money to assist local initiatives, 
             which included providing sanitary pads to secondary school pupils, furnishing primary 
             schools with desks, and promoting environmental protection programs in educational institutions.
